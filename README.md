# JBIL â€“ Java Bytecode Instrumentation Library
A simple, small, lightweight library for instrumenting Java bytecode when retransforming classes with jvmti.

# Library can:
- Finding entries in the constant pool
- Add your own entries to the constant pool
- Finding methods
- Change methods bytecode

# Examples
Before you start working with the library, you must include the "ClassFile.hpp" header and initialize the class you want to work with

Further work with the class will be done via cf object
### Finding entries in the constant pool

All types of constants can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4 "The constant pool")

### Finding methods and changing bytecode
Note: The "Bytecodes.hpp" header must be included before changing method bytecode
